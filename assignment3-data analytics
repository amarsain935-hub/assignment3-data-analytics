Assignment 3 – Matplotlib & Seaborn
Dataset: Titanic Dataset
🔵 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Step 1: Import Required Libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.set_style("whitegrid")

Step 2: Load the Dataset
df = pd.read_csv("titanic.csv")
print(df.head())
print(df.info())

Explanation:

read_csv() loads the dataset.

head() shows first 5 rows.

info() displays data types and missing values.

Step 3: Check for Missing Values
print(df.isnull().sum())

Explanation:

isnull() detects missing values.

sum() counts total missing values in each column.

Step 4: Fill Missing Age Values (Using Median)
df["Age"].fillna(df["Age"].median(), inplace=True)

Explanation:

Median is used because Age may contain outliers.

It replaces missing Age values with the median.

Step 5: Fill Missing Embarked Values (Using Mode)
df["Embarked"].fillna(df["Embarked"].mode()[0], inplace=True)

Explanation:

mode() returns the most frequent value.

Missing Embarked values are replaced with the most common port.

Step 6: Drop Unnecessary Columns
df.drop(["Name", "Ticket", "Cabin"], axis=1, inplace=True)

Explanation:

These columns are not useful for visualization.

axis=1 means column removal.

🔵 2️⃣ Univariate Analysis

(Univariate analysis studies one variable at a time.)

📊 A) Distribution of Age (Histogram + KDE)
plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.histplot(df["Age"], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title("Distribution of Age")
plt.show()

Explanation:

Histogram shows frequency distribution.

KDE shows smooth density curve.

Most passengers were between 20–40 years old.

📊 B) Count of Passengers by Sex (Bar Chart)
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
sns.countplot(x="Sex", data=df)
plt.title("Count of Passengers by Sex")
plt.show()

Observation:

There were more male passengers than female passengers.

📊 C) Distribution of Fare (Boxplot)
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
sns.boxplot(y="Fare", data=df)
plt.title("Fare Distribution")
plt.show()

Explanation:

Boxplot shows median, quartiles, and outliers.

There are many high-fare outliers.

🔵 3️⃣ Bivariate Analysis

(Bivariate analysis studies the relationship between two variables.)

📊 A) Survival Rate by Sex (Countplot)
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
sns.countplot(x="Sex", hue="Survived", data=df)
plt.title("Survival Rate by Sex")
plt.show()

Observation:

Female passengers had a higher survival rate than males.

This reflects the “Women and children first” policy.

📊 B) Pclass vs Fare (Boxplot)
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
sns.boxplot(x="Pclass", y="Fare", data=df)
plt.title("Pclass vs Fare")
plt.show()

Observation:

First-class passengers paid the highest fare.

Third-class passengers paid the lowest fare.

📊 C) Age vs Fare (Scatter Plot, Color-coded by Survival)
plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.scatterplot(x="Age", y="Fare", hue="Survived", data=df)
plt.title("Age vs Fare (Colored by Survival)")
plt.show()

Observation:

Passengers who paid higher fares had better survival chances.

Younger passengers also had relatively higher survival rates.

🎯 Final Conclusion

Female passengers had the highest survival rate.

First-class passengers had better survival chances.

Fare is positively related to survival probability.

Most passengers were between 20–40 years old.

Data cleaning is an essential step before visualization.
